  <!-- Absolute Position - The element is positioned relative to its first positioned element. Which means when you use absolute positioning you are actually taking the element out of the flow of the document. And it no longer is considered a part of the natural flow of the document. That's why when you set the position of the yellow div to absolute, you will see the yellow box get moved, while the red and blue div gets moved up. As if the yellow div was deleted and the red div is actually now the first div. Play around with different divs and move the boxes around to see what happens when you change the absloute position. This time at the end of this activity, place the three boxes diagonally where they are touching each other at the corner. Change the order also, from yellow-blue-red to blue-red-yellow. Be sure to style the body as well and set the margin to 0 to remove all default margins in the browser.	 -->
